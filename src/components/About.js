              Founded in 2020, Shiv Aurica emerged from a passion for authentic
              Indian cuisine. Our journey began with age-old family recipes
              passed down through generations, combining traditional flavors
              with modern culinary techniques.

              Today, we pride ourselves on delivering the true essence of Indian
              hospitality and cuisine. Every dish tells a story of India's rich
              culinary heritage, prepared with carefully selected spices and
              ingredients to ensure an authentic dining experience.
